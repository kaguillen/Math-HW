Relax Conditions 
You need to relax your vision and get ideas from the periphery.
Like Pólya’s mouse, constantly be on the lookout for twists and turns and tricks. Don’t get locked into
one method. Try to consciously break or bend the rules

GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY 
This is easy and fun to do. Stay loose and experiment. Plug in lots of num-
bers. Keep playing around until you see a pattern. Then play around some more, and try to
figure out why the pattern you see is happening. It is a well-kept secret that much high-level
mathematical research is the result of low-tech “plug and chug” methods. The great Carl Gauss,
widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians in history (see page 64), was a big fan of
this method. In one investigation, he painstakingly computed the number of integer solutions to
𝑥2 + 𝑦2 ≤ 90,000.3

WISHFUL THINKING
These strategies combine psychology and mathematics to
help break initial impasses in your work. Ask yourself, “What is it about the problem that makes
it hard?” Then, make the difficulty disappear! You may not be able to do this legally, but who
cares? Temporarily avoiding the hard part of a problem will allow you to make progress and may
shed light on the difficulties. For example, if the problem involves big, ugly numbers, make them
small and pretty. If a problem involves complicated algebraic fractions or radicals, try looking
at a similar problem without such terms. At best, pretending that the difficulty isn’t there will
lead to a bold solution, as in Example 2.1.1 on page 14. At worst, you will be forced to focus
on the key difficulty of your problem, and possibly formulate an intermediate question, whose
answer will help you with the problem at hand. And eliminating the hard part of a problem, even
temporarily, will allow you to have some fun and raise your confidence. If you cannot solve the
problem as written, at least you can make progress with its easier cousin!

FIND A PENULMATE STEP 
Once you know what the desired conclusion is, ask yourself, “What will yield
the conclusion in a single step?” Sometimes a penultimate step is “obvious,” once you start
looking for one. And the more experienced you are, the more obvious the steps are. For example,
suppose that 𝐴 and 𝐵 are weird, ugly expressions that seem to have no connection, yet you must
show that 𝐴 = 𝐵. One penultimate step would be to argue separately that 𝐴 ≥ 𝐵 AND 𝐵 ≥ 𝐴.
Perhaps you want to show instead that 𝐴 ≠ 𝐵. A penultimate step would be to show that 𝐴 is
always even, while 𝐵 is always odd. Always spend some time thinking very explicitly about
possible penultimate steps. Of course, sometimes, the search for a penultimate step fails, and
sometimes it helps one instead to plan a proof strategy (see Section 2.3 below
